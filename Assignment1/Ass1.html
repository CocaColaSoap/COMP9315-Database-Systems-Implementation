<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
PostgreSQL has an extensibility model which, among other things,
provides a well-defined process for adding new data types into
a PostgreSQL server.
This capability has led to the development by PostgreSQL users
of a number of types (such as polygons) which have become part
of the standard distribution.
It also means that PostgreSQL is the database of choice in research
projects which aim to push the boundaries of what kind of data a
DBMS can manage.
</p>
<p>
In this assignment, we will be adding a new data type for dealing
with <b>email addresses</b>.
You may implement the functions for the data type in any way you like
<em>provided that</em> they satisfy the semantics given below (in the
<a href="#semantics">Email Address Data Type</a> section).
</p>
<p>
The process for adding new base data types in PostgreSQL is described
in the following sections of the PostgreSQL documentation:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/19T2/postgresql/documentation/xtypes.html">38.12 User-defined Types</a>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/19T2/postgresql/documentation/xfunc-c.html">38.10 C-Language Functions</a>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/19T2/postgresql/documentation/xoper.html">38.13 User-defined Operators</a>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/19T2/postgresql/documentation/sql-createtype.html">SQL: CREATE TYPE</a>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/19T2/postgresql/documentation/sql-createoperator.html">SQL: CREATE OPERATOR</a>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9315/19T2/postgresql/documentation/sql-createopclass.html">SQL: CREATE OPERATOR CLASS</a>
</ul>
<p>
Section 38.12 uses an example of a complex number type, which you can use as
a starting point for defining your <tt>EmailAddr</tt> data type (see below).
There are other examples of new data types under the directories:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <tt><i>PG_CODE</i>/contrib/chkpass/</tt> ... an auto-encrypted password datatype
<li> <tt><i>PG_CODE</i>/contrib/citext/</tt> ... a case-insensitive character string datatype
<li> <tt><i>PG_CODE</i>/contrib/seg/</tt> ... a confidence-interval datatype
</ul>
<p>
These may or may not give you some useful ideas on how to implement the
Email address data type.
</p>

<h2>Setting Up</h2>

<p>
You ought to start this assignment with a fresh copy of PostgreSQL,
without any changes that you might have made for the Prac exercises
(unless these changes are trivial).
Note that you only need to configure, compile and install your
PostgreSQL server once for this assignment.
All subsequent compilation takes place in the <tt>src/tutorial</tt>
directory, and only requires modification of the files there.
</p>
<p>
Once you have re-installed your PostgreSQL server, you should run
the following commands:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>cd <i>PG_CODE</i>/src/tutorial</b>
$ <b>cp complex.c email.c</b>
$ <b>cp complex.source email.source</b>
</pre>
<p>
Once you've made the <tt>email.*</tt> files, you should also edit the
<tt>Makefile</tt> in this directory and add the
<span class="green">green</span> text to the following lines:
</p>
<pre>
MODULES = complex funcs <span class="green">email</span>
DATA_built = advanced.sql basics.sql complex.sql funcs.sql syscat.sql <span class="green">email.sql</span>
</pre>
<p>
The rest of the work for this assignment involves editing only the
<tt>email.c</tt> and <tt>email.source</tt> files.
In order for the <tt>Makefile</tt> to work properly, you must use
the identifier <tt>_OBJWD_</tt> in the <tt>email.source</tt> file
to refer to the directory holding the compiled library.
You should never modify directly the <tt>email.sql</tt> file produced
by the <tt>Makefile</tt>.
Place <em>all</em> of you C code in the <tt>email.c</tt> file;
do not create any other <code>*.c</code> files.
</p>
<p>
Note that your submitted versions of <tt>email.c</tt> and <tt>email.source</tt>
should not contain any references to the <tt>complex</tt> type. Make sure that
the documentation (comments in program) describes the code that <i>you</i>
wrote.
</p>

<a name="semantics"></a>
<h2>The Email Address Data Type</h2>

<p>
We wish to define a new base type <tt>EmailAddr</tt> to represent
RFC822-style email addresses (actually a subset of RFC822).
We also aim to define a useful set of operations on values of type
<tt>EmailAddr</tt> and wish to be able to create indexes on <tt>EmailAddr</tt>
attributes.
How you represent <tt>EmailAddr</tt> values internally, and how you
implement the functions to manipulate them internally, is up to you.
However, they must satisfy the requirements below.
</p>
<p>
Once implemented correctly, you should be able to use your PostgreSQL
server to build the following kind of SQL applications:
</p>
<pre>
create table UserSessions (
   username  EmailAddr,
   loggedIn  timestamp,
   loggedOut timestamp
   -- etc. etc.
);

insert into UserSessions(username,loggedIn,loggedOut) values
('jas@cse.unsw.edu.au','2012-07-01 15:45:55','2012-07-01 15:51:20'),
('jas@cse.unsw.EDU.AU','2012-07-01 15:50:30','2012-07-01 15:53:15'),
('z9987654@unsw.edu.au','2012-07-01 15:51:10','2012-07-01 16:01:05'),
('m.mouse@disney.com','2012-07-01 15:51:11','2012-07-01 16:01:06'),
('a-user@fast-money.com','2012-07-01 15:52:25','2012-07-01 16:10:15');

create index on UserSessions using hash (username);

select a.username, a.loggedIn, b.loggedIn
from   UserSessions a, UserSessions b
where  a.uname = b.uname and a.loggedIn &lt;&gt; b.loggedIn;

select path,count(*)
from   Users
group  by path;
</pre>
<p>
Having defined a hash-based file structure, we would expect that the
queries would make use of it. You can check this by adding the keyword
<tt>EXPLAIN</tt> before the query, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
db=# <b>explain analyze select * from UserSessions where username='a@b.com';</b>
</pre>
<p>
which should, once you have correctly implemented the data type
and loaded sufficient data, show that an index-based scan of the
data is being used.
</p>

<h3>Email address values</h3>

<p>
The precise format of email addresses is defined in the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/">RFC822 standard</a>,
which describes the overall structure of emails (headers,
content format, etc.), including addresses.
An alternative, and perhaps more user-friendly, description of
email addresses can be found on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address">Wikipedia</a>.
We will implement a subset of the RFC822 address standard,
which can described as follows:
<ul>
<li>
an email address has two parts, Local and Domain, separated by an
'@' char
<li>
both the Local part and the Domain part consist of a sequence of
Words, separated by '.' characters
<li>
the Local part has one or more Words;
the Domain part has two or more Words (i.e. at least one '.')
<li>
each Word is a sequence of one or more characters, starting with a letter
<li>
each Word ends with a letter or a digit
<li>
between the starting and ending chars, there may be any number of letters,
digits or hyphens ('-')
</ul>
A more precise definition can be given using a BNF grammar:
</p>
<pre>
EmailAddr ::= Local '@' Domain

Local        ::= NamePart NameParts

Domain       ::= NamePart '.' NamePart NameParts

NamePart     ::= Letter | Letter NameChars (Letter|Digit)

NameParts    ::= Empty | '.' NamePart NameParts

NameChars    ::= Empty | (Letter|Digit|'-') NameChars

Letter       ::= 'a' | 'b' | ... | 'z' | 'A' | 'B' | ... 'Z'
Digit        ::= '0' | '1' | '2' | ... | '8' | '9'
</pre>
<p>
You may assume that the maximum length of the Local part is 256 chars,
and that the maximum length of the Domain part is also 256 chars.
</p>
<p>
Under this syntax, the following are valid email addresses:
</p>
<pre>
jas@cse.unsw.edu.au
john-shepherd@hotmail.com
john.a.shepherd@gmail.com
J.Shepherd@unsw.edu.au
j.a.shepherd@acm.org
j-a-shepherd@bargain-hunter.com
jas@a-very-silly-domain.org
john1988@my-favourite.org
x-1@gmail.com
a@b.c.com
</pre>
<p>
The following addresses are not valid in our system,
despite some of them being allowed under RFC822:
</p>
<pre>
jas@cse
"jas"@cse.unsw.edu.au
j..shepherd@funny.email.org
123jas@marketing.abc.com
john@123buynow.com.au
john@cse.unsw@edu.au
x--@gmail.com
</pre>
<p>
Think about why each of the above is invalid in terms of the
syntax definition For example, <tt>jas@cse</tt> is invalid
because the domain part is required to have at least two
dot-separated components (in our system, we are dealing only
with full domain names).
Another example: <tt>123jas</tt> is invalid because each
part of a name must start with a letter.
</p>
<p>
<b>Important</b>: for this assignment, we define an ordering on
email addresses as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the ordering is determined initially by the ordering on the Domain parts
<li> if the Domains are equal, then the ordering is determined by the Local parts
<li> ordering of parts is determined lexically and is case-insensitive
</ul>
<p>
There are examples of how this works in the section on
<a href="#operations">Operations on email addresses</a> below.
</a>

<h3>Representing email addresses</h3>
<p>
The first thing you need to do is to decide on an internal representation
for your <tt>EmailAddr</tt> data type.
You should do this, however, after you have looked at the description of
the operators below, since what they require may affect how you decide
to structure your internal <tt>EmailAddr</tt> values.
You should also take into account that email addresses are to be
treated as case-insensitive. E.g. all of the following addresses
are equivalent:
</p>
<pre>
jas@cse.unsw.edu.au   jas@cse.unsw.EDU.AU   JAS@cse.unsw.EDU.AU
JaS@CsE.UnSw.eDu.aU   jAs@CSE.UNSW.edu.au   jas@CSE.unsw.EDU.au
</pre>
<p>
The <em>canonical form</em> of an email address is one in which all
letters are lower-case, e.g. the first address above.
At the SQL level, email addresses are entered and displayed as SQL
strings. These strings will not necessarily be in
canonical form when they are entered via a database client.
</p>
<p>
When you read strings representing <tt>EmailAddr</tt> values, they
are converted into your internal form, stored in the database in this form,
and operations on <tt>EmailAddr</tt> values are carried out using this
data structure.
When you display <tt>EmailAddr</tt> values, you should show them in
canonical form, regardless of how they were entered or how they are stored.
<p>
The first functions you need to write are ones to read and display
values of type <tt>EmailAddr</tt>. You should write analogues of the
functions <tt>complex_in()</tt>, <tt>complex_out</tt> that are defined
in the file <tt>complex.c</tt>.
Make sure that you use the <tt>V1</tt> style function interface (as is
done in <tt>complex.c</tt>).
</p>
<p>
Note that the two input/output functions should be complementary, meaning
that any string displayed by the output function must be able to be read
using the input function.
There is no requirement for you to retain the precise string that was
used for input (e.g. you could store the <tt>EmailAddr</tt> value
internally in canonical form).
</p>
<p>
If you want to use an open-source email address parser from the Net,
that's fine, but you will most likely need to modify it so that it
only accepts valid addresses as defined by the grammar above.
If you include in your submission an email parser and if it accepts
email addresses that are not valid according to our grammar, you
will lose marks.
You must insert all of the parser code in the <tt>email.c</tt> file.
</p>
<p>
Note that you are <em>not</em> required to define binary input/output functions,
called <tt>receive_function</tt> and <tt>send_function</tt> in the
PostgreSQL documentation, and called <tt>complex_send</tt> and
<tt>complex_recv</tt> in the <tt>complex.c</tt>file.
</p>
<p>
A possible representation for <tt>EmailAddr</tt> values would involve
fixed-size buffer(s), large enough to hold the longest possible email
address: 256 + 256 + '@' + ...
However, this is a poor representation because most email addresses
are much shorter than 512+ characters.
Using a fixed-size representation for <tt>EmailAddr</tt> limits your
maximum possible mark to 8/13.
</p>

<a name="operations"></a>
<h3>Operations on email addresses</h3>
<p>
You must implement all of the following operations for the <tt>EmailAddr</tt>
type:
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b><i>Email<sub>1</sub> = Email<sub>2</sub></i></b> ...
two email addresses are equivalent
</p>
<p>
Two email addresses are equivalent if, in their
canonical forms, they have the same Local part and the same Domain part.
</p>
<pre>
Email<sub>1</sub>: jas@cse.unsw.edu.au
Email<sub>2</sub>: jas@cse.unsw.EDU.AU
Email<sub>3</sub>: jas@abc.mail.com
Email<sub>4</sub>: richard@cse.unsw.EDU.AU

(Email<sub>1</sub> = Email<sub>1</sub>) is true
(Email<sub>1</sub> = Email<sub>2</sub>) is true
(Email<sub>2</sub> = Email<sub>1</sub>) is true        <i>(commutative)</i>
(Email<sub>2</sub> = Email<sub>3</sub>) is false
(Email<sub>2</sub> = Email<sub>4</sub>) is false
</pre>
<li>
<p>
<b><i>Email<sub>1</sub> &gt; Email<sub>2</sub></i></b> ...
the first email address is greater than the second
<p>
<i>Email<sub>1</sub></i> is greater than <i>Email<sub>2</sub></i> if,
in their canonical forms,
the Domain part of <i>Email<sub>1</sub></i> lexically greater
than the Domain part of <i>Email<sub>2</sub></i>.
If the Domain parts are equal, then <i>Email<sub>1</sub></i> is greater than <i>Email<sub>2</sub></i> if the Local part of <i>Email<sub>1</sub></i>
is lexically greater than the Local part of <i>Email<sub>2</sub></i>.
</p>
<pre>
Email<sub>1</sub>: jas@cse.unsw.edu.au
Email<sub>2</sub>: jas@cse.unsw.EDU.AU
Email<sub>3</sub>: jas@abc.mail.com
Email<sub>4</sub>: richard@cse.unsw.EDU.AU

(Email<sub>1</sub> &gt; Email<sub>2</sub>) is false
(Email<sub>1</sub> &gt; Email<sub>3</sub>) is true
(Email<sub>2</sub> &gt; Email<sub>3</sub>) is true
(Email<sub>1</sub> &gt; Email<sub>1</sub>) is false
(Email<sub>4</sub> &gt; Email<sub>3</sub>) is true
</pre>
<li>
<p>
<b><i>Email<sub>1</sub> ~ Email<sub>2</sub></i></b> ...
Email addresses have the same Domain <small>(note: the operator is a tilde, <em>not</em> a minus sign)</small>
<p>
Two email addresses come from the same Domain if their Doman parts are equal.
</p>
<pre>
Email<sub>1</sub>: jas@cse.unsw.edu.au
Email<sub>2</sub>: jas@cse.unsw.EDU.AU
Email<sub>3</sub>: jas@abc.mail.com
Email<sub>4</sub>: richard@cse.unsw.EDU.AU

(Email<sub>1</sub> ~ Email<sub>1</sub>) is true
(Email<sub>1</sub> ~ Email<sub>2</sub>) is true
(Email<sub>2</sub> ~ Email<sub>3</sub>) is false
(Email<sub>3</sub> ~ Email<sub>2</sub>) is false      <i>(commutative)</i>
(Email<sub>2</sub> ~ Email<sub>4</sub>) is true
</pre>
<li>
<p>
Other operations: &nbsp; <b><tt>&lt;&gt;</tt></b>, &nbsp; <b><tt>&gt;=</tt></b>, &nbsp;
<b><tt>&lt;</tt></b>, &nbsp; <b><tt>&lt;=</tt></b>,  &nbsp; <b><tt>!~</tt></b>
</p>
<p>
You should also implement the above operations, whose semantics is
hopefully obvious from the three descriptions above.
The operators can typically be implemented quite simply in terms of
the first three operators.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Hint:</b> test out as many of your C functions as you can <em>outside</em>
PostgreSQL (e.g. write a simple test driver) before you try to
install them in PostgreSQL. This will make debugging much easier.
</p>
<p>
You should ensure that your definitions <em>capture the full semantics of
the operators</em> (e.g. specify commutativity if the operator is commutative).
You should also ensure that you provide sufficient definitions so that
users of the <tt>EmailAddr</tt> type can create hash-based indexes
on an attribute of type <tt>EmailAddr</tt>.
</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>
You need to submit two files: <tt>email.c</tt> containing the C
functions that implement the internals of the <tt>EmailAddr</tt>
data type, and <tt>email.source</tt> containing the template SQL commands
to install the <tt>EmailAddr</tt> data type into a PostgreSQL server.
Do not submit the <tt>email.sql</tt> file, since it contains
absolute file names which are not helpful in our test environment.
If your system requires other <tt>*.c</tt> files, you should submit
them along with the modified <tt>Makefile</tt> from the
<tt>src/tutorial</tt> directory.
</p>
